 Lingua-Jspell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lingua-Jspell is a morphological analyser. Its first version were
distributed based on a C package with autoconf/automake/libtool
configuration. Given that main usage of Jspell is done through its Perl
interface, Jspell is now made available as a Perl module, that includes
the original C code unmodified.

For the installation you need a C compiler and YACC or Bison. The
building tools will try to detect them but it is not guaranteed that
they will be detected correctly.

Please refer to the documentation or http://natura.di.uminho.pt/ for
further details on Jspell usage and Jspell dictionaries.
