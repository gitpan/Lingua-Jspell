This grammar is the I<jspell> portion that differs from the I<ispell>
one that can be found, complete and commented on I<ispell> manual.

=head2 Word Classification

The power of affix files was augmented using a classification option
field that is, not more than a string (between quotes) where we can
write anything but, for usability, should contain the word classification.

Example:

  flag p: ; "CAT=adj_nc"

  I L > -L, S ; "N=p"   # il->is (funil ---> funis)

In this case, "N=p" means that the application of this rule, the word
number (C<N>) will be plural (C<p>). The C<CAT=adj_nc> string is only
usefull when using the C<-c> flag or when using the library
C<get_roots(...)> function.

=head2 Suffixes' suffixes

Another change was adding the C<+> operator that provides a way that a
flag can be used on a flagged word, or, in another words, mean it can
be suffixed.


=head1 THANKS

We should thanks Pace Willisson and Geoff Kuenning for putting
C<ispell> as a open source application, from where much of this
application code was borrowed.
