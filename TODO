 TODO Items for Lingua::Jspell
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Before a stable release I would like that Ken Williams make a public
   release of ExtUtils::CBuilder that compiles correctly under 
   Windows. This would make me happy!

 - Make jbuild and jspell link to the built dynamic library.

 - Add tests for all the tools. Not sure if they should rely on the
   Portuguese dictionary (in which case we need to download it before
   than we are doing now) or in a small hand-made dictionary for test
   purposes. Probably the second approach needs more work but might be
   more efficient.

 - Although I spent a lot of time making agrep compile without
   warnings, I would love to get rid of it and use Perl directly. It
   would not waste time starting a new process and it would make
   portabiity easier.

 - The dictionary installation procedure requires LWP::Simple and
   Archive::Any. Probably these two modules should be made a
   requirement so no user ends up installing the module without a
   dictionary to test it with.
